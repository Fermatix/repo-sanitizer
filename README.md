# repo-sanitizer

CLI tool for anonymizing Git repositories before sharing with third parties.

Takes a local path or URL as input. Produces a `git bundle` with fully rewritten history — no PII, secrets, or internal infrastructure data in any commit on any branch.

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Install
pip install repo-sanitizer

# 2. Set salt (required — never passed via CLI)
export REPO_SANITIZER_SALT="$(openssl rand -hex 32)"

# 3. Sanitize
repo-sanitizer sanitize ./my-project \
  --rulepack ./rules \
  --out ./sanitized-output

# 4. Check result
cat sanitized-output/artifacts/result.json

# 5. Share the bundle
git clone sanitized-output/output/sanitized.bundle ./verification
```

### Batch (a list of local repos / bundles / URLs)

To sanitize many repositories in one run, put one source per line in a text
file (local paths, `.bundle` files, or Git URLs — `#` comments and blank lines
ignored; see [`repos.example.txt`](./repos.example.txt)) and use `sanitize-batch`:

```bash
export REPO_SANITIZER_SALT="$(openssl rand -hex 32)"   # same salt across runs

repo-sanitizer sanitize-batch ./repos.txt \
  --rulepack ./examples/rules \
  --out ./out \
  --workers 8
```

**Before a batch run:** install [`gitleaks`](https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks#installing)
(required — the run aborts up front if it is missing), and make sure you have
plenty of free disk: each repo is a **full clone with history**, so a few
hundred repos is tens of GB.

Each repo's result lands in `./out/<key>/` (same layout as a single
`sanitize`). A `./out/batch_summary.json` is written and
`./out/.sanitize_batch_state.json` lets a re-run skip finished repos (add
`--retry-failed` to redo failures). This is local-only — no GitLab discovery
or push (for that, see `repo-sanitizer batch run`).

NER is **off by default** for batch runs (no GPU/model load) — pass
`--ner-scope head` (or `all`) to enable name/org detection, which starts one
shared NER service for the whole batch.

**Authentication.** Before any work starts, a pre-flight checks access to each
remote URL, in order: (1) existing HTTPS credentials (credential helper or a
token in the URL); (2) **SSH** with your keys (the URL is cloned over SSH if
that works); (3) if a terminal is attached, it prompts once per host for a
token. If a repo still can't be reached, the run aborts up front (listing
them) instead of failing workers mid-run — pass `--no-preflight` to skip the
check. For a fully unattended run, configure credentials beforehand
(token-in-URL `https://oauth2:<TOKEN>@host/...`, a credential helper, or an
ssh-agent key).

## Features

| What gets detected | How |
|---|---|
| Secrets (API keys, tokens, passwords) | gitleaks |
| Emails, phone numbers, IPv4 addresses, JWTs, URLs | Regex patterns |
| Internal domains and private IPs (RFC 1918) | EndpointDetector |
| Names and organizations | NER transformer model |
| Custom terms (project codenames, client names) | Dictionary (Aho-Corasick) |

| What gets rewritten | Scope |
|---|---|
| Working tree files | Comments and string literals only (tree-sitter zones) |
| Commit metadata | Author name, email, commit message — all branches |
| File content in history | All unique blobs across all branches |
| Denied files | Removed from every commit |

| Output | |
|---|---|
| `sanitized.bundle` | Git bundle, cloneable |
| `result.json` | Gate results, SHA-256 of bundle, timings |
| Scan reports | Pre/post findings for working tree and history |

All replacements are **deterministic**: same salt + value → same output every time.

## Installation

### Requirements

| Tool | Version | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Python | ≥ 3.11 | Runtime |
| [gitleaks](https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks) | any | Secret detection (required) |
| git | ≥ 2.35 | Clone, log, bundle |

### Python package

```bash
# With uv (recommended)
uv add repo-sanitizer

# With pip
pip install repo-sanitizer

# With all tree-sitter grammars (165+ languages)
pip install "repo-sanitizer[grammars]"
```

### gitleaks

```bash
brew install gitleaks        # macOS
sudo apt install gitleaks    # Linux
scoop install gitleaks       # Windows
```

### NER model (optional, downloaded automatically)

On first run, `transformers` downloads `Davlan/bert-base-multilingual-cased-ner-hrl` (~700 MB) to `~/.cache/huggingface/`. See [docs/offline.md](docs/offline.md) for air-gapped setup.

> **GPU requirement:** NER inference (`--ner-device cuda`) requires a GPU with at least **12 GB VRAM** (e.g. NVIDIA RTX 3080 Ti 12 GB or better). On devices with less VRAM, use `--ner-device cpu` or run a shared `ner-service` on a capable machine.

---

## CLI

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `sanitize <source>` | Full pipeline: clone → scan → redact → rewrite history → bundle |
| `scan <source>` | Read-only audit — no changes made |
| `install-grammars` | Verify and install tree-sitter grammar packages |
| `batch run` | Process thousands of GitLab repositories in parallel |
| `batch list` | Dry-run: enumerate repositories without processing |
| `ner-service` | Start a shared NER inference service (foreground); multiple `sanitize`/`scan` runs share one GPU process |

### `sanitize` options

| Option | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--rulepack PATH` | — | Path to rulepack directory (required) |
| `--out PATH` | — | Output directory (required) |
| `--rev REV` | `HEAD` | Git revision for working tree checkout |
| `--salt-env VAR` | `REPO_SANITIZER_SALT` | Name of env variable holding the salt |
| `--max-file-mb N` | `20` | Skip files larger than N MB |
| `--history-since DATE` | — | Limit history scan start date (git format: `2024-01-01`) |
| `--history-until DATE` | — | Limit history scan end date |
| `--ner-device DEVICE` | `cpu` | NER device: `cpu` \| `cuda` \| `cuda:0` \| `auto` |
| `--ner-service-url URL` | — | URL of a running `ner-service`. Skips local model loading; multiple runs share one service |

**Exit codes:** `0` = all gates passed, `1` = one or more gates failed.

### `scan` options

Same options as `sanitize`. Produces `inventory.json`, `scan_report_pre.json`, `history_scan_pre.json`, `history_blob_scan_pre.json`. No files are modified.

### Adding a new detector

```python
# repo_sanitizer/detectors/my_detector.py
from repo_sanitizer.detectors.base import Category, Detector, Finding, ScanTarget, Severity

class MyDetector(Detector):
    def detect(self, target: ScanTarget) -> list[Finding]:
        findings = []
        # ... detection logic ...
        return findings
```

Register in `steps/scan.py` → `build_detectors()`.

## Limitations

The following are out of scope:

- PR/MR data from GitHub/GitLab API
- Wiki repositories
- LFS objects (pointer files are deleted; LFS content is not fetched)
- Recursive submodule processing (`.gitmodules` URLs are caught by EndpointDetector)
- Renaming files or directories whose paths contain PII
- EXIF metadata in images
- Commit signatures (stripped during history rewrite, not analyzed)
